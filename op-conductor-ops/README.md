# op-conductor-ops

op-conductor-ops is a CLI tool for managing op-conductor sequencer clusters.

**WARNING!!! This tool can cause a network outage if used improperly. Please consult #pod-devinfra before using.**

## Setup

Requires [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).

Install python dependencies with `poetry install`.

## Usage

After installing dependencies with `poetry`, the tool can be invoked with `./op-conductor-ops`,
which just calls `poetry run python main.py` and passes on any arguments.

### Example Usage

* Example usage with implicit config file with lookup at ./config.toml
```./op-conductor-ops status <network-name>```

* Usage with explicit path to config and certificate
```./op-conductor-ops  -c ./<path>/config.toml --cert ./<path>/cacert.pem  <command> <network-name>```

## Example Configuration File: example.config.toml

This configuration file is used to set up the networks and sequencers for your application.

### Structure

The configuration file is divided into two main sections:

1. **Networks**: This section defines the networks that your application will use. There is an example network configuration (`op-network-1`) and a blank network configuration (`op-network-N`) for you to fill out.

2. **Sequencers**: This section defines the sequencers for each network. Again, there is an example sequencer configuration for `op-network-1` and a blank sequencer configuration for `op-network-N`.

Is is recommended to update the network name and sequencer names for your specifc configuration in the toml object declaration

### Config Usage

1. Copy this file to `config.toml` in your application's root directory.
2. Modify the example configurations or fill out the blank configurations as needed for your application.
3. Save the `config.toml` file and use it to configure your application's networks and sequencers.

Remember, the example configurations are provided for your convenience, but you should review and update them to match your specific requirements.
